      <h3>Resurrection Stone</h3>

        The Resurrection Stone was one of the fabled Deathly Hallows. In "The Tale of the Three Brothers", it was the second Hallow created, supposedly by Death himself. It was bestowed upon Cadmus Peverell after he requested, as his bounty,
        something with the power to recall loved ones from Death. According to legend, whoever reunited it with the other two Hallows (the Elder Wand and the Cloak of Invisibility) would become the Master of Death.[1]

        It was one of the two Hallows known to have been successfully passed down from generation to generation since Cadmus' time. In 1943 it passed to the possession of Tom Riddle who unknowingly stole it while it was still concealed in Marvolo
        Gaunt's Ring, which he turned into a Horcrux. The ring was destroyed in 1996 by Albus Dumbledore, but the stone was placed in Harry Potter's first Golden Snitch until it passed into the possession of Harry Potter who used it to great success
        in the Second Wizarding War.

        According to legend, whoever reunited it with the other two Hallows, the Elder Wand and the Cloak of Invisibility, would become the Master of Death. This is likely not to be taken literally. Harry Potter possessed all three Hallows yet never
        became the Master of Death as in conquering death. It meant that to be "Master of Death" was to accept one's mortality.[1]

        It is said to be the only object that would bring back the spirits of the holder's deceased loved ones, activating when turned three times in the user's hand. These shades are said to dislike being drawn from their rightful afterlife.

        Grindelwald mistakenly believed that the Stone could be used to create an army of Inferi.

        Harry Potter successfully used it to summon images of his deceased loved ones, including James Potter and Lily Evans. Their exact nature was unclear, and they made no complaint about being summoned. These shades are more physically solid than
        a ghost but less so than a living body. Harry described them as almost transparent. They remained visible only as long as the stone was held, and produced a Patronus-like effect that shielded against Dementors.[6]

        Sometime after Cadmus's death (or perhaps even by Cadmus himself), the Resurrection Stone was fitted into a ring. This ring was passed down as a family heirloom for the Peverell family, and eventually the Gaunt family, as knowledge of what
        the Stone was, and even what the symbol on it meant, became lost. Eventually, it made its way into the possession of Marvolo Gaunt, who would use the ring to flaunt the purity of his blood, such as he did to Bob Ogden when the latter came to
        call about Morfin Gaunt's attack on Tom Riddle Snr.[2]

        After Marvolo died shortly after serving a six-month sentence in Azkaban for attacking Bob Ogden, the ring was inherited by his son Morfin. He would wear the ring until Tom Riddle came to the Gaunt shack seeking information about his
        wizarding family. Sensing that the ring was a family heirloom, Riddle would pocket it after killing his Muggle relatives and framing Morfin for the murder.[3]

        For the greater part of the Horcrux hunt, Harry Potter kept the Snitch containing the Stone in his mokeskin pouch. He was unable to get to the stone inside, due to charms placed upon it by Albus Dumbledore. On May 2, 1998 the Battle of
        Hogwarts broke out. During the one-hour armistice that marked the end of the first half of the battle, Harry found out through the memories of Severus Snape that he himself was the last Horcrux. As he was walked to his death Harry was finally
        able to retrieve the Stone. He placed the Snitch to his lips and revealed his intentions to die.At this, the Snitch opened and the Stone fell into his hand. Harry turned it over in his hand thrice, and was immediately joined by the shades of
        his parents, Sirius Black, and Remus Lupin. The presence of his loved ones was enough to give him the courage to keep going, and they remained with him until he made his way to where Voldemort was. At this point, the stone slipped from
        Harry's hands and he never went to search for it, with the intention that it would be lost in the forest forever.
